##Homework

Some of the chapters have homeworks at the end, which require simulators and other code. More details on that, including how to find said code, can be found here: [HOMEWORK](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/Homework/homework.html)

Each simulator has a README file that explains how to run the simulator.

**NEW: Video.** Each simulation will soon have a short video with one of the authors introducing the basic concepts of how to use the simulator to generate homework problems.

## PROJECTS

While the book should provide a good conceptual guide to key aspects of modern operating systems, no education is complete without projects. We are in the process of making the projects we use at the University of Wisconsin-Madison widely available; an initial link to project descriptions is available here: [PROJECTS.](https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-projects) Coming soon: the automated testing framework that we use to grade projects.

## Books

Of course, we assume some background in [The C Programming Language](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0131103628/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0131103628&linkCode=as2&tag=opesysthrea0a-20&linkId=RI2L6WG3HGZM2GXG)![img](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=opesysthrea0a-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0131103628), so that's a good investment. And [Advanced Programming in the UNIX Environment](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321637739/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321637739&linkCode=as2&tag=opesysthrea0a-20&linkId=4HWBBZINQQWXE53A)![img](http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=opesysthrea0a-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0321637739) is a must for any shelf. 

###The necessary background material

- The C Programming Language
- Introduction to Computing Systems: From Bits and Gates to C and Beyond
- Computer Systems: A Programmerâ€™s Perspective

## Howto

Throughout the chapters, we try to use real code(not pseudocode)where possible, so for virtually all examples, you should be able to type them up yourself and run them. Running real code on real systems is the best way to learn about operating systems, so we encourage you to do so when you can. We are also making code available at https://github.com/remzi-arpacidusseau/ostep-code for your viewing pleasure.
